This is a command line utility tool I wrote for cleaning media directories, specifically for TV shows (the file name for torrented shows can get messy). It searches a directory for files containing the name of a show, moves them into a new directory, and renames them in a consistent format. The full version requires an api code from https://www.themoviedb.org/ (to get the year), but it should work in offline mode as is.
