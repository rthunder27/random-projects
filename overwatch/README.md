Script for downloading player profiles from https://playoverwatch.com/ . I wrote this to be run daily to track the Skill rating of my friends (since that's how often the stats are updated) by cron, and haven't done anything to make it portable (ie, all paths are hardcoded, as well as the gamertags). I also have some code that parses the full html file and pulls out all of the competitive stats, but that has not been worked into this file yet.
