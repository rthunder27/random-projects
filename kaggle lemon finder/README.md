This is a notebook I put together as part of a take home assignment for a job interview. The kaggle challenge can be found  [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/DontGetKicked) . 
A guideline for the interview assignment was not to spend more than eight hours working on it, so please bear that in mind. I will do an update with some of the feedback I received
during the interview, as well as things I didn't have time to implement (such as pulling in external data sources).
