This directory contains the Jupiter Notebook in which I reproduced the Jeopardy analysis I originally did in Matlab back in 2009. The jupyter notebook is a mess, combining the web scraping from j-archive.org along with the code to produce the graphs and tables seen in the pdf report. 

The PDF is in rough, but presentable form. I might work on getting it into a publishable shape at some point.
