# random-projects
Collection of a few small projects to demonstrate basic coding/ML competency to potential employers. 

Kaggle Lemon Finder is my solution to a kaggle problem that I completed as part of a job interview process. Of these projects it is the one that most shows off my data science skills.

Jeopardy contains a game theoretic analysis of wagering behavior in the final round of the game show Jeopardy, highlighting a few persistent sub-optimal choices contestants make. Contains the notebook with the web-scraping code, as well as the code used to generate the visuals in the pdf (it's a messy notebook that I should clean up).

Media Directory Cleaner is a small program I wrote to help clean up a directory of TV shows. It renames the files to have the same convention, and moves them into a folder for each show (in case one theoretically occasionally downloads tv shows via torrents). Nothing technically impressive here, just some competent scripting.

Overwatch is pretty sparse right now, it just contains the code for pulling some stats on a daily basis. I need to update this with some other code I wrote that pulls all the stats from the downloaded pages, and organizes it into a CSV, which I then feed into Tableau.
